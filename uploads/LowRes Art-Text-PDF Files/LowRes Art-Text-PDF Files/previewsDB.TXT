This new graphic novel by acclaimed creator MIRKA ANDOLFO (UNNATURAL) is a gothic horror tale where mysteries and unspeakable sins are blended together in a unique and sensual way.   Washington State, late nineteenth century. During the frenzied historical era commonly known as the Klondike Gold Rush, a mysterious woman arrives in Woodsburgh, a small mining town close to the Canadian border.  It's been a few years since the Swanson mine was closed following the terrible accident that claimed the lives of so many men and women, including the owner's and the city it's still struggling in search for a new place on the map of the country.   Elegant and extraordinarily wealthy, Lady Hellaine arrives in the city accompanied by her faithful butler Goodwill and settles in one of the most luxurious mansions in town. A lifestyle that contrasts sharply with that of the majority of the population, forced to choose between humble crafts and illegal activities.  No one is aware of the reasons that led such a classy lady to move from Seattle to the small village, but her arrival certainly did not go unnoticed. Especially in the eyes of Lady Swanson, widow of the late mine owner and leading figure of the local bourgeoisie. Lady Hellaine's plans will bring her on a collision course with the powerful Lady Swanson, who, for reasons not entirely rational, distrusts the newcomer.  Meanwhile, the streets and surroundings of Woodsburgh are flooded in blood: a heinous creature is killing incautious citizens, wreaking havoc on their bodies. Enough to induce local authorities to impose a strict curfew after sunset.  And with the falling of the first snow, the 'Woodsburgh Devil''s fury seems to have even increased. What's the connection, if any, between this disturbing presence and the ivory-skinned stranger?  Who is Lady Hellaine, really? And what's her secret agenda?

"SEP201108"	"WILD MINDS ARTISTS & RIVALRIES INSPIRED GOLDEN AGE ANIMATION (C: 0-1-0)"	28.00	"The vivid and untold story of the Golden Age of classic animation and the often larger-than-life artists who created some of the most iconic cartoon characters of the twentieth century  In 1911, famed cartoonist Winsor McCay debuted one of the first animated cartoons, based on his sophisticated newspaper strip 'Little Nemo in Slumberland,' itself inspired by Freud's recent research on dreams. McCay is largely forgotten today, but he unleashed an art form, and the creative energy of artists from Otto Messmer and Max Fleischer to Walt Disney and Warner Bros.' Chuck Jones. Their origin stories, rivalries, and sheer genius, as Reid Mitenbuler skillfully relates, were as colorful and subversive as their creations-from Felix the Cat to Bugs Bunny to feature films such as Fantasia-which became an integral part and reflection of American culture over the next five decades.  Pre-television, animated cartoons were aimed squarely at adults; comic preludes to movies, they were often 'little hand grenades of social and political satire.' Early Betty Boop cartoons included nudity; Popeye stories contained sly references to the injustices of unchecked capitalism. 'During its first half-century,' Mitenbuler writes, 'animation was an important part of the culture wars about free speech, censorship, the appropriate boundaries of humor, and the influence of art and media on society.' During WWII it also played a significant role in propaganda. The Golden Age of animation ended with the advent of television, when cartoons were sanitized to appeal to children and help advertisers sell sugary breakfast cereals.

A loner and an introvert, Chris has worked in Breakwater Picture House for many years. It's the kind of job that people drift through; friendships flourish for a time, contained within their allotted hours and place...and then fade when people move on. But when Dan joins, Chris finds someone who breaks out of these designated boundaries and gradually becomes a part of her life. Initially the relationship helps her out of a rut and she finds her world starting to open up. But as she learns more about her new friend, she must decide if the solitary life she's built is the one she's actually most suited to after all. Dealing with issues of mental health, the joys and drawbacks of choosing a casual job over a career path and the burden that comes with letting other peoples' problems into your life, Breakwater is a stunning second graphic novel from the creator of Follow Me In."

Hanawalt's outlandish humor and ingenious formalism are evident in the comics collected here. Her love of anthropomorphism and scatology are on full display, all lovingly and grotesquely drawn by Hanawalt in obsessive, unnerving detail. A master humorist and cartoonist, Hanawalt strikes the perfect balance of drawing the gorgeous and the repugnant, the fantastical and the lifelike, the bizarre and the hilarious-creating a deeply human experience that everyone can relate to."

Feeling a bit lonely and out of place, she's desperate for community and a sense of belonging. An anarchist student-activist committed to veganism and shoplifting, Zena offers Sophie a whole new political ideology that feels electric. Enamored - of Zena, of the idea of living more righteously - Sophie finds herself swept up in a whirlwind friendship that blows her even farther from her rural Californian roots as they embark on a disastrous hitchhiking trip to Amsterdam and Berlin full of couch surfing, drug tripping, and radical book fairs.

Autobiography blends with fiction in these coming-of-age stories about people reckoning with their place in their community and women coming to terms with other women. A boy living with HIV tries to decide how he's going to tell his parents-or whether he should tell them at all. A mother puts pressure on her daughter to pass her exams, and the stress of it all drives them both to drink, fueling a toxic relationship with a lot of care just below the ugly surface. Another girl keeps getting bruises, but who's inflicting the damage-herself or a loved one?

No one bites-they're all busy or maybe they just don't want to party-but he's determined to make this night something to remember. Victoria is lively and energetic, but surrounded by friends and family who are buzzkills, always worrying about what is best for her. Rodolphe glumly considers his own misery and then suddenly snaps out of it, becoming the life of the party. The three careen through the city's nightlife spots and underbelly, chasing pleasure-or at least a few distractions from their daily lives. Each has a series of adventures that reveal them to be teetering on the edge between lucid dream and tooth-grinding nightmare."	"(W/A/CA) Brecht Evens"

Left unspoken but lingering in the background is Paul's divorce after a three decade relationship with his high school sweetheart. Online dating only seems to make the world worse. Rabagliati doesn't shy away from these intimate issues, approaching them as much with self-deprecating humor as with sorrow or pain. "	"(W/A/CA) Michel Rabagliati"

Bagge combined his cartoony drawing style with uncomfortably real Gen X characters, and the comic books resonated with readers. Book One (Hate 1-15), focuses on young Buddy Bradley's travails in early 1990s Seattle. Book Two focuses on Buddy and his girlfriend Lisa Leavenworth's move back to Buddy's native New Jersey (and a switch from black-and-white to full color). Book Three features the final arc of Bagge's magnum opus, as Buddy and Lisa become parents (and buy a garbage dump).

Created in the 1960s, The Party takes place in the Hamptons. It's attended by captains of industry, tycoons, magnates, moguls, and various undistinguishable fat cats, luxuriating in their tuxedos, evening gowns, and prattling small talk. The depiction of one grotesquerie after another - often couples - cavorting through the haze of booze and caviar, with the occasional wanton display of sybaritically libidinal impulse. Ungerer accompanies each full-page image with a hilarious, hand-lettered caption, which provides the characters' names and a brief deadpan description of their social standings, creating a dissonance between image and text.

In the 1950s, pioneering comics writer Héctor Germán Oesterheld authored the serialized science-fiction adventure story The Eternaut, now a seminal Argentine graphic novel. In 1969, Oesterheld rebooted his narrative as a dark warning for a mature readership; Alberto Breccia manifested the tonal shift with an expressionistic, disorienting art style.  In The Eternaut 1969, a deadly 'snow' falls. Juan Salvo's small household of family and friends are spared, protected inside his home-but what horror awaits them in the silent, deserted streets of Buenos Aires? Venturing out in search of supplies, our everyday heroes soon join the resistance against an enemy far more sinister than anything they could have imagined."

American comics creators such as Frank Miller (300, Sin City) and Mike Mignola (Hellboy) owe Breccia a great debt; these horror-adventure tales are as thrilling, dread-inducing, and accessible as when they were created a half a century ago."

After five agonizing years as a prisoner of war and five months on a grueling march homeward, Rene Tardi, the legendary cartoonist's father, is awarded fifteen days of military leave. Rene struggles to rebuild his health, reconnect with his family, and imagine his future. With limited job opportunities, Rene re-enlists as a soldier, despite his disgust. After the birth of his son, Jacques, Rene receives new orders: return to Germany and help rebuild the country that imprisoned him. The story takes an autobiographical turn as the focus shifts to Jacques' recreated childhood memories and an exploration of the traumatic effects of war that ripple through the generations.

"SEP201233"	"I RENE TARDI PRISONER OF WAR IN STALAG IIB HC VOL 01"	29.99	"In September 1939, René Tardi went to war. Less than a year later, the French army was defeated and he was a prisoner of war, like 1.6 million other French soldiers. After 4 years and 8 months in a POW camp, René returned home, bitter and ashamed. Stalag IIB is Jacques Tardi's homage to his father and a testimony to the silent suffering of a generation of men. Based on René's memories, Stalag IIB - the first of two volumes - recounts brutal years of captivity under the Nazis and the POWs' attempts to reclaim moments of humanity. René recalls the roll calls in sub-zero temperatures, daily acts of resistance, crushing boredom - and especially the omnipresent hunger. With four decades of cartooning and almost two dozen graphic novels behind him, Jacques Tardi masterfully recreates historical and personal details with remarkable fidelity, guided by extensive research and his father's notes. Featuring some of Tardi's most intense and meticulous drawing, punctuated by somber greys and punches of red and blue rendered beautifully by Rachel Tardi, Stalag IIB is a personal and artistic triumph."

Picking up where Vol. 1 left off, the second volume of Stalag IIB begins when captured French soldier Ren. Tardi finally gets a taste of freedom, as prisoners and German officers alike are forced to evacuate the POW camp he has languished in for the past four years. Thus begins the long, grueling journey eastward, where Tardi and his fellow POWs must evade the pursuing Russian Army, stave off their gnawing hunger, and contend with the increasingly illtempered and vicious German soldiers accompanying them. Throughout this harrowing odyssey, the only thing that keeps him going is the hope that he'll one day return home to France, where his wife Henriette patiently awaits him. Featuring meticulous line work punctuated by stunning splashes of color, Jacques Tardi's grim yet heartening biographical portrait of his father's life as a soldier during WWII is a personal and artistic triumph."

Referred to by comic strip historian Maurice Horn as the 'granddaddy of all costumed superheroes,' The Phantom was created in 1936 by Lee Falk with artwork by Sy Barry.

The Phantom set the standard for action, adventure, intrigue, and romance in adventure comic strips and comic books - it has frequently been copied but never equaled.  This exciting 20th volume continues the SY BARRY YEARS! Reprinted in all its black and white glory, journey with Hermes Press as we bring you five complete continuities drawn by Sy himself: 'Bullet's Town,' 'The Killer,' 'The Sea God,' 'The Satchel,' 'The Crime School,' 'Deadman's Point,' and 'The Rogue Elephant.'

Yehuda and Maya Devir began illustrating their life together in comics in 2016, when they moved into their first apartment in Tel Aviv as newlyweds. In the years since, One of Those Days has become one of the biggest viral webcomics on the Internet, with millions of followers around the world.  Yehuda Devir grew up on superhero comic books, and the Devirs' visual style is colorful, dynamic, and engaging. But the comics' action-packed style belies their intimate, slice-of-life content: Yehuda does battle with the hairy, tentacled monstrosity clogging the shower drain; Maya transforms into a raging She-Hulk while waxing her legs; and the two of them dodge, duck, and weave as they tend to their cherubic new baby, Ariel.  This collection is the first time that the Devirs' comics have been compiled in one volume-in it, they share stories that are heartwarming, hilarious, and universally recognizable, all rendered in a wild, larger-than-life style. Even for those who don't pull out an assault rifle to wage war against a cockroach, the Devirs' challenges and triumphs are familiar to anyone who's ever had one of those days.

This impeccably British character created by author Ian Fleming has starred in 25 EON-produced films, played by six different actors over five decades.

Once they had that long-awaited book, some found themselves overwhelmed by the variety and abundance, as well as the sheer size of the book. As one reviewer wrote, 'let's give credit to Amazon for… the strength of its packaging. Who wants a 2-ton pussy book being 'exposed' for the mailman…?' For those who worry that there can be too much of a good thing, we've made a pared down, 'best of' edition of The Big Book of Pussy, a petite little kitten of a book that puts those in-your-face photos in proper perspective. Now you can follow the evolution of genital exposure with ease, through 100 years of photos with one thing in common: the exhibitionistic pleasure with which the models present their feminine pulchritude. And with over 150 photos-36 new to this book-of the pet we love to pet, no bothersome text to interrupt the flow, all in a package that won't stress the mailman's back, we just may have produced the perfect self-gifter of the year."

In 1999, creator George Lucas began the story of how Anakin Skywalker grew up to train as a Jedi under Obi-Wan Kenobi, found love with the Queen of Naboo, Padmé Amidala, before turning to the dark side of his nature and becoming more machine than man. After driving the development of nascent digital technology, George Lucas perceived how he could create new creatures and new worlds on a grander scale than ever before. He created the first digital blockbuster, and met fierce resistance when he pushed for widespread digital cameras, sets, characters, and projection - all of which are now used throughout the industry. He essentially popularized the modern way of making movies. Made with the full cooperation of George Lucas and Lucasfilm, this second volume covers the making of the prequel trilogy - Episode I The Phantom Menance, Episode II Attack of the Clones, and Episode III Revenge of the Sith - and features exclusive interviews with Lucas and his collaborators.

Gwen vaults across rooftops, keeping a watchful eye out for trouble while jammin' to her favorite tunes in our amazing Ghost-Spider Q-Fig Elite Diorama. Whether she's drumming for The Mary Janes or battling the Kingpin, Gwen's love of music is apparent in everything she does and in our incredibly detailed sculpt.

With beloved illustrator Shunya Yamashita's expert design, Leatherface's appearance has been fully revamped while retaining its original look! This BISHOUJO rendition of Leatherface can be seen wearing only a shirt, pulling attention to Bubba Sawyer's large body which has been adapted into a voluptuous physique. Leatherface's hollow expression along with her reddened face and slightly open mouth show that she has lost all sense of control. The blood splatters on the yellow apron have been painted with a glossy paint in order to reproduce the look of slimy blood. The original bloody chainsaw design - a symbolic weapon in The Texas Chainsaw Massacre - was perfectly turned into 3D data, and was then adjusted to the size of the BISHOUJO statue in order to retain the authenticity. The base has been designed in a diorama-style with dust, feathers, and a scattering of bones and teeth which add to the eerie atmosphere of the Sawyer home. A human skin masked face part is also included, allowing you to recreate Leatherface as close to the original form as possible. Quiet madness is now at your fingertips."	""

These hunters were a superhuman soldiers designed to use a special armor type developed by Hakua Riken along with Monoceros, and are known as the black hunter, or Quetzal.  Like Monoceros, these super soldiers have artificially strengthened tissue, but Quetzal's design and purpose varied from its counterpart. Quetzal was designed with highly sensitive vision, hearing, and olfactory perception abilities, giving it innate threat perception capabilities that drastically increase its ability to survive on the battlefield. In contrast with Monoceros, which was designed as an offensive model, Quetzal is designed to defend its allies, and has proven highly effective in the field.  Compared to the white soldier Monoceros, which emphasizes ferocity and battle-honed reflexes, Quetzal favors balance and stability. Due to the nature of the machine, Quetzal does not require as many cerebral nerve modifications as its counterpart, and is comparatively less harsh on subjects. For this reason, Quetzal is used more widely than Monoceros.  Due to the fact that the Ex Armor Types and the super soldiers that pilot them are both extremely new weapon systems, there are few active models seen on the battlefield. Despite this fact, the Liberty Alliance's perception of the armor types and soldiers is favorable, and there are high expectations for Hakua Riken's super soldiers in the future.  Weapons: ? Security Cloak ? Compound Bow ? Crossbow  Model Specifications: ? Despite its small stature of 89mm, the model boasts 28 points of articulation. ?
